Initially, I was site engineer to support big banking customers, got lots of practice during there. The experience of 4 years F5 support (TAC) let me know how to handle complicated issues, people, or technical case. I am familiar with K8s, Docker, service mesh, NGINX, Ansible, DNS, HTTP, SSL, TCP, UDP, WAF, Load balance, Identity Access Management, CDN, Web Accelerator, TCL programming. I like to dig the root of cause when I immerse in troubleshooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the TAC role, I moved to F5 APAC consulting team, I am the first one consultant in GCG.As a consultant, I delivered complicate post-sale and pre-sales projects for APAC customers. Appreciate the 4 years’ experience, I am better on time/project management and communications.&lt;/p>

I got the Open Group TOGAF v9.2 certificate and I am CNCF Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA #664), own CCNP/MCSE/JNCIS certificates. After F5 acquiring NGINX, I built NGINX Accreditation exam process and questions. I am also the first one F5 certified security solution expert in China. Beside those, I am also interested to open source technology like service mesh(Istio, envoy),observability(ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) etc.&lt;/p>
